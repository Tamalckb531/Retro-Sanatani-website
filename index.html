                <p>Best Bhagavad Gita Learnings Shared by Lord Krishna: <br>
                    1. Whatever happened, happened for the good. Whatever is happening, is happening for the good. Whatever will happen, will also happen for the good. <br>
                    2. You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. <br>
                    3. Change is the law of the universe. You can be a millionaire, or a pauper in an instant. <br>
                    4. The soul is neither born, and nor does it die. <br>
                    5. You came empty handed, and you will leave empty handed. <br>
                    6. Lust, anger and greed are the three gates to self-destructive hell. <br>
                    7. Man is made by his belief. As he believes, so he is. <br>
